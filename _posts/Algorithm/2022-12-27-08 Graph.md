# Overview for Graph

Assumption is that we cover simple graph!
- edges are distinct(No multi-edges)
- edge for distinct vertices(No slef loops)

## Notation

- V: set of vertices
- E$\subseteq V\times V$: set of pairs of vertices
- Direction : Directed/Undirected! We can distinguish them wheter edge are in parenthessis or curly bracket. curly bracket is for set notation which does not has order(undirected!)
- Neighbor
  - outgoing neighbor set : $Adg^+$
  - ingoing neighbor set : $Adg^-$
- degree: cardinality for neighbor


## Graph Representation

We can store graph as a set data structure which maps vertex to (outgoing) neighbors or adjacency list.<br>
Adjacency list is based on DAA or hash table when it requires fast mapping as possible.<br>
Or we can use array or linked list for iteration.<br>
As a result we store domain and codomain! that's why it requires **linear** time $\Theta(\mid V \mid+ \mid E \mid)$. The reason why we distinguish vertices set and edges set is that it depends on circumstances. For sparse environment, cardinality of edges set is much less than quadratic

# Path

Regarding path, there are 3 problems

- single pair reachablility(graph G, vertex s, vertex t)
- single pair shortest path(graph G, vertex s, vertex t)
- single source shortest paths(graph G, vertex s): returns shortest path tree for all vertices of graph

## Shortest Paths Tree

For source vertex $s$, we'd like to know shortest path for each vertex in graph. To do so, it may takes quadratic if we search whole vertices for every vertex. Then we use "parent" concept so that trace the path. If we arrive at the leaf with respect to the source vertex, then look back the parent vertex which takes $O(\mid V \mid)$.

# Connectivity

We consider undirected graph for connectivity in this course.

Connected (undirected) graph is a graph whose paths are connecting every vertices.

## Connected component

parition of $V$ into subsets which subgraph for corresponding subset is connected. 

# Topological Sort

- Topological Order

ordering $f$ of vertices such that every edge $(u,v)$ satisfies $f(u)<f(v)$

- Finishing Order

order completed Full-DFS vertices.<br> completed vertex comes first 

KEY! **If G is Directed Acyclic Graph(DAG), reverse of a finishing order is topological order**.

Personally, we can interprete as follows:<br>
topologically far vertex is the latest recursion! Therefore, reverse of a finishing order is order of topoligically distance.

# Cycle Detection

For directed graph, we can detect cycles in graph. This is available because for every DAG, the above statement satisfies. That is, if graph is not DAG, then every directed graph but not an acyclic graphs which contains cycles cannot satisfy that statement.

To return cycles, trace ancestor(or parent) in Full-DFS
