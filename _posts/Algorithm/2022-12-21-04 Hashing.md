# Comparison Model

Return value for comparison is binary.

Then we can apply comparison for set interface to support (static) **find** operation! <br>
At this moment, all we need to do is **count** comparision which is time complexity!

This can be considered as decision (binary) tree. Leaves are items of set and a "none" case to support non-exist key. 

## Properties
- **# of leaves** is (**# of items + 1**).
- **# of comparison** becomes the **longest path** from root to leaf.
- **minimum height of tree** is $\theta(\log(n))$
