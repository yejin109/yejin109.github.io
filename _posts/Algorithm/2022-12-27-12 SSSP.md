# DAG Relaxation

Beause our interest of graph is DAG, we can compute topological order with finishing order of G.

- Idea

**Maintain a distance estimate** $d(s,v)$ which is initialized as infinitiy for every vertex. We can think of this strategy as gradually lowering the upper bound by updating distance estimates. 

=> start from overestimates and lower it!

- **Triangle inequality**

the shortest path weight from $u$ to $v$ cannot be greater than the shortest path from $u$ to $v$ through **another** vertex 

$\delta(u,v) \le \delta(u,x) + \delta(x,v)$ for all $u,v,x \in V$

- Update condition

Update when triangle inequality does not satisfy. The thing is that estimates are not correct so we define update condition as follows:

$If (u,v) \in E s.t. d(s,v) > d(s,u)+w(u,v)$ then $d(s,v) \gets d(s,u) + w(u,v)$<br>
In this case, we say that we **relax $(u,v)$** which make shortest path from $s\to v$ to $s\to u \to v$

- Safe relaxation

When maintaing each distance estimates $d(s,v)$ is a $w(\pi)$ from $s$ to $v$!

(Proof) In the algorithm we update distance as cumulative summation of weight!


## Algorithm

- Initialize $d(s,v) = \infty $ for all $v \in V$
- Set $d(s,s) = 0$
- $u \in V$ along with the topological order of G(G is DAG!!)
  - For each $v \in Adj^+(u)$
    - If update condition is satisfied, relax edge!
