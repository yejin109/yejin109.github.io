# Overview

We do not cover undirected graph because negative edge makes negative weight cycle!

# DAG Relaxation

Beause our interest of graph is DAG, we can compute topological order with finishing order of G.

- Idea

**Maintain a distance estimate** $d(s,v)$ which is initialized as infinitiy for every vertex. We can think of this strategy as gradually lowering the upper bound by updating distance estimates. 

=> start from overestimates and lower it!

- **Triangle inequality**

the shortest path weight from $u$ to $v$ cannot be greater than the shortest path from $u$ to $v$ through **another** vertex 

$\delta(u,v) \le \delta(u,x) + \delta(x,v)$ for all $u,v,x \in V$

- Update condition

Update when triangle inequality does not satisfy. The thing is that estimates are not correct so we define update condition as follows:

$If (u,v) \in E s.t. d(s,v) > d(s,u)+w(u,v)$ then $d(s,v) \gets d(s,u) + w(u,v)$<br>
In this case, we say that we **relax $(u,v)$** which make shortest path from $s\to v$ to $s\to u \to v$

- Safe relaxation

When maintaing each distance estimates $d(s,v)$ is a $w(\pi)$ from $s$ to $v$!

(Proof) In the algorithm we update distance as cumulative summation of weight!

## Algorithm

- Initialize $d(s,v) = \infty $ for all $v \in V$
- Set $d(s,s) = 0$
- $u \in V$ along with the topological order of G(G is DAG!!)
  - For each $v \in Adj^+(u)$
    - If update condition is satisfied, relax edge!

# Bellman-Ford

This algorithm is devised to 
- solve weighted shortest path **with cycle & negative weights.**
- return for all vertices
  - unreachable vetex returns infinity
  - reachable via negative cycle return negative infinity

- $k$-Edge Distance

$\delta_k(s,v)$ weight of a shortest path from $s$ to $v$ using less than $k$ edges!

## Negative Cycle Witness

- THe first statement! 

>
  If $\delta(s,v) \ne - \infty$, $\delta(s,v) = \delta_{\mid V \mid -1}(s,v)$ since a shortest path is simple!

If $\delta_{\mid V \mid} (s,v) < \delta_{\mid V \mid -1}(s,v)$ then there exist a shorter **non-simple** path which implies $\delta_{\mid V \mid}(s,v) = - \infty$ and negative cycle.

Then we say that it is a witness vertex $v s.t.$ belongs to negative cycle.<br>
That's why it is shorter distance with more vertices!

The thing is that inverse statement does not hold! There could be exit a vertex with $\delta = -\infty$ but does not satisfies that inequality.

- The second statement!

>
  If $\delta(s,v) = -\infty$ then $v$ is reachable from a witness

Every negative weight cycle is reachable from witniess! We can prove it with triangle inequality.

- Summary

1. If K-edge distance constraint does not hold, it is a witness 
2. If a vertex is witness then it is reachable from that vertex

## Graph Duplication

make $\mid V \mid +1$ levels of duplicates!

![제목](/assets/images/algorithm/12-0.PNG){: width="70%" height="55%"}{: .align-center}

## Algorithm

- Run graph duplication and return new graph G'
- Run DAG Relxation on G' from $s_0$ and compute all distances from $s_0$
- For each vertex, $d(s,v) = \delta(s_0, v_{\mid V \mid -1})$
