# Definition and Symbols

Series
- partial sum $s_m$. If $\limit s_m= s$ then we can treat it asa number
- Given sequence $x_n$, $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} which is associated to $x_n$.
- If sequence $\lbrace s_m = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} x_n\rbrace_{m=1}^{\infty}$ converges then series converges either!
- (RMK) Do not ahve to start seriest at $n=1$

Cauchy series
- sequence of partial sumis Cauchy


# Questions to be solved

1. Does $\limit x_n= 0$ implies $\sum x_n$ converges?


# Theorem

> If $\lvert r\rvert then \sum r^n$ converges and $\sum r^n= {1\over 1-r}$

Approach
- From definition via induction

Remark
Series of the form from the above is called geometric series.

> For sequence $x_n$ and $M\in\mathbb{N}$, $\sum_{n=1} x_n$ converges $\iff \sum_{n=M} x_n$ converges

> $\sum x_n$ is Cauchy $\iff \sum x_n$ is convergent

Remark
- For sequence, the above relation is false.

> $\sum x_n$ is Cauchy $\iff \forall \epsilon >0, \exists M\in\mathbb{N} s.t. \forall m\ge M and l>m, \lvert \sum_{n=m+1}^l x_n\rvert < \epsilon$

Remark
- Convergence(or Cauchu) of series depends on the tail of series

> If $\sum x_n$$ converges then $\limit x_n=0$ 


> $\sum {1\over n} does not converge

Approach
- Find the minimum of fraction of series.
- Then the minimum is unbounded!

Remark
- Series $\sum {1\over n} $ is called harmonic series

> If $\forall n\in\mathbb{N}\ge 0$ then $\sum x_n$ convergence $\iff s_m$ is bounded.
