This contents is based on Lecture of 18.100A of MIT Open Course. Coverage will be Lecture from 4~. [link](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-100a-real-analysis-fall-2020/video_galleries/video-lectures/)

# Overview

All we need to know once we learn about it is
- Useful inequality manipulation!
  - inequality is relevent lubp!


# Definition and Symbols

Field
- Two operations matter!
  - Addition and multiplication
  - Some properties should be satisfied

Ordered field
- ordered set $F$ with ordering $< s.t.$ 
  - $\forall x,y,z\in F, x<y \Rightarrow x+z<y+z$
  - $x>0 \mbox{ and } y>0 , \mbox{ then } xy>0$

$x+A$
- $\lbrace x+a \mid a\in A\rbrace$

$xA$
- $\lbrace xa \mid a\in A\rbrace$

Absolute value
- $\mid x\mid = x$ for $x\ge 0$ o.w. $-x$

## Theorem

> Let $F$ be an ordered field with the least uppber bound property. If $A \subset F$ is **nonempty** and **bounded below**, then $\inf A$ exist in $F$

Approach
- use $-A$ and find $\sup(-A)$ first
  - LUBP is impactful! 
- use definition of infimum and supremum.
  - most of relation is based on the fact that it is ordered field.

> There exists a **unique** ordered field, which is $\mathbb{R}$, satisfying that $\mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{R}$ and LUBP.

Approach
- Order property
  - prove existence of supremum
  - use the above theorem.
- Algebric property
  - prove uniqueness of supremum
  - uniqueness comes from equality
  - use the fact that it is a field


> (Archimedian Property, AP) If $x,y\in \mathbb{R}$ and $x>0$, then $\exists n\in \mathbb{N}$ s.t. nx>y

Assumption
- $x,y\in \mathbb{R}$
- $x>0$
  - $x$ could be any positive value(even $\epsilon$!)

Want to show that
- $\exists n \in \mathbb{N} s.t. n>{y\over x}$

Approah
- Contradiction!
- $\mathbb{N}$ has lupb!
- find otehr value which is bigger than supremum

> (Density of Q) If $x,y in \mathbb{R}$ and $x<y$ then $\exists r\in \mathbb{Q} s.t. x<r<y$

so to speak,
- rational numbers are dense in $\mathbb{R}$
- We can find another number which exists between for a pair of given real numbers.

Assumption
- $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$
- $x<y$

Want to show that
- $ny>nx+1$
- find $j\in \mathbb{N} s.t. nx<j, j\le nx+1$

Approach
- Split cases with respect to zero!
  - we only solve the case of positive interval. Negative inteval case will be followed.
- AP does matter!
  - Derive that $n(y-x)>1$
  - Derive $S=\lbrace k\in \mathbb{N}:k>nx \rbrace$
- WOP for the smallest value.


> $x = \sup S \iff x$ is upper bounded for $S$ and $\forall \epsilon >0, \exists y \in S s.t. x-e<y\le x$

This is important theorem!

Assumption
- $S \subset \mathbb{R}$
- $S$ is nonempty and bounded above.

> $\sup(x+A)=s+\sup A, \sup(xA)=x\sup A$ 

Assumption
- $x\in\mathbb{R}$
- $A$ is bounded above

Approach
- Derive upper bound for $x+A$
- And then derive equality!
  - Proof for existence of upper bound is not enough
  - We need to prove that exact supremum of set. Use iff relation!
