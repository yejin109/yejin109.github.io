# Theorem

1. De Morgan's Law
2. For $c\ge -1 \mbox{ and } n\in \mathbb{N}, (1+c)^n \ge 1+nc$
3. Cantor-Schroder-Bernstein
  - $\mid A \mid \ge \mid B \mid$  and $\mid A \mid \le \mid B \mid$  then $\mid A \mid = \mid B \mid$ 
4. Archimedian Property
  - It is useful when it comes to prove ineqaulity in other theorems.
5. Density of $\mathbb{Q}$

# AXIOM

1. Well-ordering propery of natural numbers
  - There is always the smallest element

Flow
- upper bound & LUBP + Field!
- $x$, Supremum of a given set 
  - upper bound for that given set 
  - find an element which belongs to that given set and exists between $(x-\epsilon,x]$
