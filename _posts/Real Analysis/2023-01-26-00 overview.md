# Theorem

1. De Morgan's Law
2. For $c\ge -1 \mbox{ and } n\in \mathbb{N}, (1+c)^n \ge 1+nc$
3. Cantor-Schroder-Bernstein
  - $\mid A \mid \ge \mid B \mid$  and $\mid A \mid \le \mid B \mid$  then $\mid A \mid = \mid B \mid$ 
4. Archimedian Property
  - It is useful when it comes to prove ineqaulity in other theorems.
5. Density of $\mathbb{Q}$
6. Squeeze theorem!
7. Reverse triangle inequality
  - $\lvert \lvert a\rvert - \lvert b\rvert\rvert \le \lvert a-b\rvert$
8. If one of elements which belongs to a set is euqal to the upper bound, and it is a supremum!
9. Bolzano-Weierstrass
  - Every bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence.
  - Once we prove a boundedness of sequence, and it is natural to assume that subsequence of that set is convergent!

# AXIOM

1. Well-ordering propery of natural numbers
  - There is always the smallest element

Flow
1. upper bound & LUBP + Field!
2. $x$, Supremum of a given set 
  - upper bound for that given set 
  - find an element which belongs to that given set and exists between $(x-\epsilon,x]$
3. proof of convergence(limits)
  - Choose $M$ with some condition.
  - Then show that $M$ works(derive inequality based on that condition and definition)
  - Or Squeeze Theorem.
    - show that is is bounded above and below and both bound converges to the same value!
  - $\lim \lvert x_n - x \rvert = 0$
