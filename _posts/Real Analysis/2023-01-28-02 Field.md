This contents is based on Lecture of 18.100A of MIT Open Course. Coverage will be Lecture from 4~. [link](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-100a-real-analysis-fall-2020/video_galleries/video-lectures/)

# Overview

All we need to know once we learn about it is
- Useful inequality manipulation!
  - inequality is relevent lubp!


# Definition and Symbols

Field
- Two operations matter!
  - Addition and multiplication
  - Some properties should be satisfied

Ordered field
- ordered set $F$ with ordering $< s.t.$ 
  - $\forall x,y,z\in F, x<y \Rightarrow x+z<y+z$
  - $x>0 \mbox{ and } y>0 , \mbox{ then } xy>0$

## Theorem

> Let $F$ be an ordered field with the least uppber bound property. If $A \subset F$ is **nonempty** and **bounded below**, then $\inf A$ exist in $F$

Approach
- use $-A$ and find $\sup(-A)$ first
  - LUBP is impactful! 
- use definition of infimum and supremum.
  - most of relation is based on the fact that it is ordered field.

> There exists a **unique** ordered field, which is $\mathbb{R}$, satisfying that $\mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{R}$ and LUBP.

Approach
- Order property
  - prove existence of supremum
  - use the above theorem.
- Algebric property
  - prove uniqueness of supremum
  - uniqueness comes from equality
  - use the fact that it is a field
